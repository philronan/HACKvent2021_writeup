# [HV21.12] Santa’s Shuffle
(Author: `2d3`)

Santa’s code is in a right mess:

```c
#include/*502_-_zU3X)}tM1#Hq$4D"35*/<stdio.h>//W6juf:tvs.]DrIoMM(axv0@|k?+jkES5r
#define/*&jhm|0zs(*/B/*zDq|:OHcU~Dv|;7,FE)9s(Ue!5gM*/break//v9BF(TT1Gq"19#?kJ2*H
#define/*JH8gDjl*/C(x)/*c9UOy:3*/case/*@MgHEK+94c9*/x/*bb]V+F#*/://u$T._.$ms'cjF
#define/*XSGrEWMy94I!VMe_n*/E(x)/*UUG9F{)zJB*/else/*CJsY*9D|SfgQ-XL*/x//s{2GfRjU
#define/*jDdwh4pU,*/F(x)/*@48h|llEw&qpgsJl7ifhb)*/if/*ux7-7_$}9*P*/(x)//s0qQes26
// ... (76 more lines of this garbage) ...
```

But wait a minute. If we treat this as C source code and delete the comments, the first line just reduces to:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
```

It even compiles without any problems to produce a program that asks for a key, and then quits. Presumably it will output something more interesting if we provide the _right_ key. To do this, we’re going to have to disentangle the code somehow. We can use the C compiler to expand all the macros defined at the top of the file:

```plaintext
$ cc -E santa_shuffle.c >santa_shuffle.expanded.c
```

That results in a rather large source file that starts with the entire content of `stdio.h`, but ends with the de-obfuscated source code of this program. After using the C formatter at https://codebeautify.org/c-formatter-beautifier to make it more legible, it became clear that the program tests each input character against the following list of char values:

```plaintext
(1<<6)+2, (4<<4)+6, 0x34, 58*2, 104, 16*5+21, 0x57, 4*25+5, 0x4E, 36, 82, 105, 103, 104, 7*16+4, (2<<5)-1
```

When converted to ASCII characters, this corresponds to the string `"BF4theWiN$Right?"`. So when the program asks for the key, enter this string and you’ll get the flag. (Apparently that long `char*` variable at the start of the code is a BrainF*ck program. I never realised.)

### Flag: `HV21{-HidDeN-bRaiNF-Ck-dEcoDer-}`
