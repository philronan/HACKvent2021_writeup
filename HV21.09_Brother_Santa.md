# [HV21.09] Brother Santa
(Author: `brp64`)

Fortunately I'd seen these [rune-esque symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cistercian_numerals) somewhere before, although I think I'd have figured it out from the challenge title and image. On the other hand, the description was decidedly gnomic:

> Ever security minded, Santa is. So switched to a _prime_ encoding system he has, after contemplating for long.

Converting each symbol to a number was easy enough:

```python
a = [2314, 6344, 6333, 4675, 2268, 3533, 763, 5940, 1707, 7377, 4022, 4870, 7382, 6109, 385, 4221]
```

But what does this challenge have to do with primes? I went down several dead ends, including decomposing each number into its prime factors to look for clues, converting them all into one giant number and factorizing that, treating each number as a Unicode code point, and ... well, I won't bore you.

I eventually discovered that the way to solve it was to convert each number into a 13-digit binary string, then separate that into 8-bit chunks that can be decoded as ASCII values:

```python
b = ''.join([bin(x)[2:].zfill(13) for x in a])
print(''.join([chr(int(b[i:i+8],2)) for i in range(0,len(b),8)]))
```

In all, this was quite a frustrating puzzle to solve. OK, so 13 _is_ a prime number. But, sheesh...
